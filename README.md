## Bonus Ideas
- Can you make the receipt flip to display some additional information on the back? HINT: You'll need to look at CSS animation and backface visibility. 
- Use CSS keyframe animations to animate in the 1, 2, 3 bubble fill. 
- Create an "image carousel" to cycle through a series of images. You'll need to add more images to your repo for this.
